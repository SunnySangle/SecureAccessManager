# üöÄ SecureAccessManager: AWS IAM Policy-Based Access Control for EC2 and EBS

## üß© Project Overview
**SecureAccessManager** demonstrates the AWS security principle **"Allow Broadly, Deny Specifically"** using **IAM Policies** and **Resource Tagging**.  

This project shows how to grant users general EC2 permissions while explicitly denying critical actions (like stopping or terminating production-tagged instances). It ensures that **production resources remain secure**, while developers can still manage non-production environments.

## üß† Learning Objective
This project is designed to:
- Understand IAM policy structure (`Effect`, `Action`, `Resource`, `Condition`)
- Implement the **Least Privilege Model** using AWS IAM
- Apply **tag-based access control** for EC2 and EBS
- Practice **real-world AWS governance** scenarios
